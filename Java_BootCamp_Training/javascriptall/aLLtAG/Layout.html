        <h1>Christmas tree</h1>
        <p>
            A Christmas tree is a decorated tree, usually an evergreen conifer such as spruce, pine, or fir or an 
			artificial tree of similar appearance, associated with the celebration of Christmas. 
			The modern Christmas tree was developed in early modern Germany (where it is today called 
			Weihnachtsbaum or Christbaum), in which devout Christians brought decorated trees into their homes.
			It acquired popularity beyond the Lutheran areas of Germany, during the second half of the 19th century, at first among the upper classes.[4]

        <h1>Chrismon tree</h1>
        <p>
            A "Chrismon tree" is a Christmas tree decorated with explicitly Christian symbols in white and gold.First introduced by North American Lutherans in 1957,[69] the practice has rapidly spread to other Christian denominations,[70] including Anglicans,[71] Catholics,[72] Methodists,[73] and the Reformed.[74]

"Chrismon" (plural "Chrismons") was adopted for the type of Christmas decoration 
and explained as a portmanteau of "CHRISt-MONOgram" (a Christogram).
